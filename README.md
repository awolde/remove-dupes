# remove-dupes

A simple script to remove duplicate files from a directory.

I have a large photo collection on my machine, and couldn't find a decent tool to cleanup the mess I make everyday.

You can make this script to create a hard link or delete the duplicate files all together.

`fdupes` can delete files automatically, but this script gives you more flexibility what you want to do with the duplicates.
